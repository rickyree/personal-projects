## Introduction 
Hi, I'm Rick. 

I'm a uni student studying biomed who recently got into coding. 

I like simple solutions to complex problems. I've been using R to organize and draw conclusions from big data. 

I'm particularly interested in coding's applications in biomedical research. 

Here are a few projects that I've been working on.


## Projects 
### Coronavirus data analyzer 
An algorithm that analyzes worldwide Covid-19 cases. 

The databank from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center is analyzed. A file from any date in this link can be used: 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports  

Outputs various statistics comparing Covid-19 cases of various countries according to user input.
