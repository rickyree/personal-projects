## Introduction 
Hi, I'm Rick. 

I'm a uni student studying biomed who recently got into coding. 

I like simple solutions to complex problems. I've been using R to organize and draw conclusions from big data. 

I'm particularly interested in coding's applications in biomedical research. 

Here are a few projects that I've been working on.


## Projects 

### R Stat Project 
A markdown notebook in R that I created for the STAT module in my course. Explores a fictional anti-viral drug VK001's therapeutic effects on different types of viruses. Demonstrates my skills in utiliizing R as a tool in data analysis and presentation. 

#### Files 

STAT_ICA1_21.rdata : database containing viral load of different types of viruses according to VK001 treatment. My job is to figure out for which virus VK001 is effective against. 

hl2320_STAT.Rmd and hl2320_STAT.html : Contains the markdown file in Rmd and html format. Needs STAT_ICA1_21.rdata to run. 

### Coronavirus data analyzer 
An algorithm that analyzes worldwide Covid-19 cases. 

The databank from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center is analyzed. An example database file is included, but any file from any date in this link can also be used: 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports  

Outputs summary statistics comparing Covid-19 cases of various countries according to user input.
